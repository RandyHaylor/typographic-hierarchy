RMCAD — Hierarchy as Communication Tool
----------------------------------------
### Visual hierarchy is deliberate information sequencing, not decoration

- Arranging information from most important to least important
- Four techniques: size/scale, color/contrast, position/alignment, typography/weight
- Follows natural scanning patterns (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- "Nothing occurs randomly" — every element is placed to shape viewer perception
- Key framing: hierarchy transforms subjective art into purposeful information delivery


MIT — Cognitive Science of Reading
-----------------------------------
### The eye doesn't read linearly — it jumps and fixates

- Reading = "fixations" (recognizing words) + "saccades" (jumps between fixation points)
- Fluent readers recognize entire word shapes, not individual letters
  - All-caps destroys word shape variation — slow and unsatisfying for body text
  - Lowercase creates ascenders/descenders that aid recognition
- Readability ≠ legibility
  - Legibility: can you distinguish individual letters?
  - Readability: speed, comprehension, error rate, preference
- Practical rules:
  - Max 2-3 typefaces per document
  - 60-75 characters per line optimal
  - Leading at 120% of font size
  - Margins help eyes locate next-line start during saccades


Texas A&M — Four Principles of Document Design
------------------------------------------------
### Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity (CRAP)

- Contrast: different elements must be *obviously* different (min 4pt size difference)
- Repetition: same-level elements formatted identically throughout
  - "Every Level 2 heading needs to be formatted in that same way"
- Alignment: left-aligned = primary; indentation = subordinate
  - Mirrors outline structure — position signals hierarchy level
- Proximity: related items close together, separated from others by white space
  - Spatial grouping lets readers understand relationships without reading


University of Illinois — Hierarchy as Accessibility
-----------------------------------------------------
### Semantic structure enables multiple consumption methods

- H1: one per page (the title)
- H2-H6: sequential, never skip levels
- Heading text must be "clear and concise"
- Structure like an essay outline — H1 is title, subsequent levels organize support
- Average online attention span: 8.25 seconds — hierarchy is how you survive that
- Proper hierarchy benefits: assistive technology, comprehension, SEO, navigation
- Lists break up text; bulleted for unordered, numbered for sequences


Cross-Cutting Themes
---------------------
### Every source agrees on these fundamentals

- Hierarchy is not optional — it's how humans process information
- Size, weight, and position are the primary signals
- Consistency within levels is as important as contrast between levels
- Readers scan before they read — hierarchy determines if they read at all
- The concept applies equally to posters, documents, UIs, and code
